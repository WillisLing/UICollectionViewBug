Demo of annoying bug with effect of sporadic app crashing!

Context: iOS 7, iPad 3!

Symptoms: do intensive scrolling /bouncing/ up and down for about 15 seconds or more :) â€¦ App will crash!
 
Empirically proven: bug appears if scroll view bounce is enabled and if collection view data is periodically reloading (see code)!
